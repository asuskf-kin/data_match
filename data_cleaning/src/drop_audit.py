"""Shared vocabulary so every pipeline step explains its drops the same way.

Each module tags the rows it removes with the columns listed in DROP_AUDIT_COLS and
returns them as the 4th element of its result tuple. main.py then writes those rows
to data/dropped/<step>.csv, so a discarded record always carries the rule that hit
it, what it matched on and which records it was grouped with.
